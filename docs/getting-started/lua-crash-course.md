# Lua Crash Course (Difficulty: Easy)

If you've never programmed in Lua, this may be worth checking out

## Target Audience

This crash course is intended to be a slightly easier-to-digest tutorial than the official introduction, called [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/). If you're already an experienced programmer, PIL will be more than sufficient. But since it can be a bit terse for beginners, this course is intended to complement it, taking a more explicit approach with a focus on important concepts covered by PIL that can be difficult to grasp.

In short: Read this, then read PIL. If you already understand PIL, just read that instead. Feel free to cross-reference when needed.

## Goals

Working through this crash course should enable a complete beginner to start developing Lua applications, regardless of the environment used. For the curious, some more advanced ideas are also introduced. These aren't really needed to start writing Lua programs, but they may be a good starting point for independent research and help to show you what else is out there.

Since it's not feasible to explain every topic in depth, you will need to follow a lot of links and make sure you've understood them well.

## Contents

We will take a look at the following topics:

* Programming 101: What you need to get started
* Where Lua differs from other languages
* Metaprogramming & Object-oriented programming
* Coroutines vs. Threads
* How Lua interacts with native C code
* What LuaJIT is and why it matters

Please note that all of the topics covered are not exclusive to Evo. There's additional tutorials for these things, which you can read later.

## Programming 101

If you've never programmed before, there are many excellent resources available online. Here's a few recommendations:

* [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming) (also covers many other areas worth studying)
* [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) explains important topics like shells, version control, and debugging
* Reddit's [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) community will answer even the most stupid questions you might have

You should make sure you have a good understanding of how your terminal works, what an interpreter is, and how it differs from a compiler. You don't have to learn Git in depth right away, but you should keep it on your radar because it's *extremely* important.

Some of the main programming concepts you absolutely need to know are these:

* Numbering systems (binary and hexadecimal)
* Boolean algebra (arithmetic and logical operations on binary numbers)
* Strings, characters, arrays, and dictionaries
* Conditionals and flow control (if, else, while, for, etc.)
* Variables and scopes
* Assembly instructions, and C compilation
* Functions, registers, and the call stack

Generally, the more you learn about how computers work, the better a programmer you will become. But the most important thing is to start simple, and don't be discouraged - there is always more to learn.
