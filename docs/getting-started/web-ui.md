# Web UI (Difficulty: Advanced)

Let's build a web application and run it from within Evo!

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you've completed the previous steps. The concept of [Async I/O](/docs/getting-started/async-io) will be especially important here!

You will also need to know a little bit (just the basics) of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)/[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - don't worry, we won't use it much.

## What we will do

Here's all the steps we'll have to go through in order to control a web-based UI from Lua:

* Make sure that you can run an embedded browser engine (varies by operating system)
* Load a simple web application written in JavaScript in a native WebView (fancy term for "browser window")
* Send data to this web application from our Lua environment, and back

Lastly, we'll take a brief look at the advantages and limitations of this approach so that you better understand your options.

## What You Will Learn

In addition to the steps needed to do all of the above, you will also absorb some important background information:
