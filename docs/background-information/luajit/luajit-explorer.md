# LuaJIT Explorer

## Optimizations

For each supported optimization heuristic, list the following info:

* Name
* When it is applied
* Location (in LuaJIT source) where it is implemented
* Example program (Lua code, bytecode, optimized trace dump)
* Caveats, gotchas and other potential things to be aware of
* TBD: API to control its behaviour? Settings, configuration options, toggle (probably already exists)
